A framework for smart contract verification in Coq.

See the [Papers](#papers) for details on the development.
ConCert can find real-world attacks as explained
[here](https://medium.com/blockchain-academy-network/finding-real-world-bugs-in-smart-contract-interactions-with-property-based-testing-9eb59b117785),

[here](https://medium.com/@bawspitters/using-formal-methods-to-prevent-creating-money-out-of-thin-air-5f30057fe3d3).

## How to build

Our development works with Coq 8.17 and depends on MetaCoq, and std++.
The tests depend on QuickChick.
The dependencies can be installed through `opam`.

Branches compatible with older versions of Coq can be found [here](https://github.com/AU-COBRA/ConCert/branches/all?query=coq-).

### Install dependencies and build ConCert locally

Installing the necessary dependencies requires the opam package manager and a switch with Coq 8.17 installed.
If you don't already have a switch set up run the following commands

```bash
opam switch create . 4.10.2 --repositories default,coq-released=https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
eval $(opam env)
```

To install the dependencies run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AU-COBRA/ConCert.git
cd ConCert
opam install ./coq-concert.opam --deps-only
```

After completing the procedures above, run `make` to build the development, and `make html` to build the documentation.
The documentation will be located in the `docs` folder after `make html`.
Example smart contracts can be built by running `make examples`.

### Install ConCert and dependencies
To install ConCert in you switch run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AU-COBRA/ConCert.git
cd ConCert
opam install ./coq-concert.opam
```

Examples can be installed by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AU-COBRA/ConCert.git
cd ConCert
opam install ./coq-concert.opam --with-test
```

## Structure of the project

Each folder contains a separate README file with more details.

The [embedding](embedding/) folder contains the development of the verified embedding of ``λsmart`` to Coq.

The [execution](execution/) folder contains the formalization of the smart
contract execution layer, which allows reasoning about interacting contracts, and perform property-based testing.
The [test](execution/test) folder contains the property-based testing framework.
The key generators used for automatically generating blockchain execution traces for
testing can be found in [TraceGens.v](execution/test/TraceGens.v).
The testing framework was developed as part of a Master's Thesis at Aarhus University,
and the thesis detailing (an earlier state of) the development can be found
[here](https://github.com/mikkelmilo/ConCert-QuickChick-Testing-Thesis).

The [extraction](extraction/) folder contains an extraction pipeline for smart contract languages.
Currently, we support smart contract languages Liquidity and CameLIGO, and general-purpose
languages Elm and Rust as targets. Pretty-printers to these languages are implemented directly in Coq.
One also can obtain an OCaml plugin for Coq by extracting our pipeline using the standard
extraction of Coq (currently, it is possible for extraction to Rust).

The [examples](examples/) folder contains examples of smart contract implementations,
embedding, extraction, and tests. Extracted smart contracts can be found
[here](https://github.com/AU-COBRA/extraction-results).

## Notes for developers

The project consists of four subprojects: `embedding`, `execution`, `extraction`,
and `examples` located in the corresponding folders.
Each subproject has its own `_CoqProject` file and `Makefile`.
The `Makefile` in the root folder dispatches the calls to the corresponding subproject.

## Documentation

The [project documentation in HTML format](https://au-cobra.github.io/ConCert/toc.html)
is generated for each build. We use the standard Coqdoc with improved styles and scripts of
[CoqdocJS](https://github.com/tebbi/coqdocjs) ([license](extra/resources/coqdocjs/LICENSE))
and local table of contents by
[TOC](https://github.com/jgallen23/toc)([license](extra/resources/toc/LICENSE)).
