(* This file defines a simple escrow contract based on the "safe remote
purchase" example in Solidity's docs. This contract allows a seller to sell an
item in a trustless setting assuming economically rational actors. With the
premise that the seller wants to sell an item for 1 ETH, the contract works in
the following way:

1. The seller deploys the contract and commits 2 ETH.
2. The buyer commits 2 ETH before the deadline.
3. The seller hands over the item (outside of the smart contract).
4. The buyer confirms he has received the item. He gets 1 ETH back
while the seller gets 3 ETH back.

If the buyer does not commit the funds, the seller gets his money back after the
deadline. The economic rationality shows up in our assumption that the seller
will confirm he has received the item to get his own funds back. *)
