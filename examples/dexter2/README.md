# Dexter 2

Formalisation of the Dexter 2 decentralised exchange based on the informal spec https://gitlab.com/dexter2tz/dexter2tz/-/tree/master/docs/informal-spec

The development consists of the following parts.

## Dexter 2 Liquidity Token

This contract is an extension of a basic FA1.2 token contract with an extra entrypoint that allows an admin to mint and burn tokens.
The purpose of this contract is to keep track of ownership of the exchanges funds.

[Dexter2FA12.v](Dexter2FA12.v) contains the implementation of the token, proofs of functional correctness properties and proofs of invariants required for inter-contract communication proofs.

## Dexter 2 CPMM

This contract is an implementation of a Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM), the main Dexter 2 functionality.

[Dexter2CPMM.v](Dexter2CPMM.v) contains the implementation along with the proofs of functional correctness properties and proofs of inter-contract invariants.
