# Extraction prototype

A prototype implementation of the extraction procedure from the deep embedding (essentially, just by printing). Currently, implements simplistic extraction to Liquidity. We also try to set use the standard Coq extraction to OCaml as a substitute for the Liquidity extraction, since the two languages are very close syntactically.
