    of the form [False]. In the default implementation, it proves
    the goal if the context contains [False] or an hypothesis of the

    finds a proof of [x <> x] for some [x]. *)

    a product and one uses the result of this function. *)

(** [unfolds] unfolds the head definition in the goal, i.e. if the
    goal has form [P x1 ... xN] then it calls [unfold P].
    If the goal is an equality, it tries to unfold the head constant
    on the left-hand side, and otherwise tries on the right-hand side.
