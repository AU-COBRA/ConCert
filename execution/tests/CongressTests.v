(* There are many issues with the property below
   Firstly: its incredibly hard to generate semantically well-formed data
   Secondly: its hard to avoid really sparse data w.r.t the property to be tested, ie. the 'isSomeCheck' will
      fail most of the time. This effect is amplified when they are nested
   Thirdly, its hard to interpret...
   Conclusion: this is perhaps abive the limit of 'functional' properties that we can test. This is probably due to the
      fact that there are so many quantified variables, many conditions in the property which have to be met
      and the fact that we quantify over *traces*.
      When dealing with traces, we should perhaps adopt a most constructive approach, and verify temporal-like properties instead. *)
