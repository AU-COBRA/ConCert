(*
  The ChainTrace datatype is defined as a ChainedList of ChainStates and ChainSteps.
  The ChainStep is an inductive relation with constructors 'step_block', 'step_action', and 'step_permute'.
  Each constructor is guarded with a number of propositions, requiring various validity conditions.

  This makes it hard to construct a generator for the ChainTrace type, so instead we initially construct a simpler model
  for chain traces, which is essentially just a list of chain states.
  But since we are working in the context of black-box testing, this may even be a better approach than trying to implement
  generators for the ChainTrace type, since we don't want to ensure/require that certain conditions hold, we only want
  to generate data from the given functions, and see what result we get.
