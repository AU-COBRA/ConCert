(* This file contains an implementation of Dexter2 liquidity contract
https://gitlab.com/dexter2tz/dexter2tz/-/blob/master/lqt_fa12.mligo
In addition this file contains proof of functional correctness w.r.t the
informal specification https://gitlab.com/dexter2tz/dexter2tz/-/blob/master/docs/informal-spec/dexter2-lqt-fa12.md

This contract is an extension of a basic FA1.2 token contract with
an extra entrypoint that allows an admin to mint and burn tokens.
It is used in the Dexter2 exchange paired with an instance of the
Dexter2 CPMM contract. The purpose of this contract is to keep track
of ownership of the exchanges funds. An user who owns x% of the supply
of liquidity tokens owns x% of the exchanges trading reserve.
