(* This file implements a 'chained list'. This can essentially be
thought of as the proof-relevant transitive reflexive closure of
a relation. That is, each link (element) has a "from" point that
must match the previous element's "to" point. *)

Lemma app_clnil_l {from to} (xs : ChainedList from to) :
  clnil ++ xs = xs.
Proof. induction xs; auto; cbn; solve_by_rewrite. Qed.
